# 👋🏾 Hey, I'm Oladotun!

I'm a **Software Engineer** crafting scalable, high-performance web apps with JavaScript (especially React & TypeScript). I thrive in the sweet spot between elegant code and delightful user experiences.

## 🛠️ Tools of My Trade:

- **Languages:** JavaScript (ES6+), TypeScript, Python
- **Frameworks:** React, Redux, Next.js, Node.js and every other shiny new technology out there
- **Testing & DevOps:** Jest, Cypress, Docker, AWS, CI/CD

## 🎯 What I'm Up To:

- Building modular front-end architectures to make browsers behave.
- Optimizing apps to run faster than your next caffeine refill.
- Occasionally convincing legacy codebases they deserve a second chance.

## ⚡ Fun Facts:

- Converts caffeine into clean code daily.
- Thinks tabs vs spaces debates should end peacefully—with spaces winning decisively.
